												<h3>Project 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At her adult age, she leaves her father's house and moves to Devghat, a religious place for Hindus. There she makes a small hut and starts to live a long, boring life. The story mainly tries to reveal the terrible cultural practice called child marriage. This story also portrays the pain of a child widow living her whole life without company. The novel best tries to shows bitter reality of Ancient Nepal where women have to suffer very much after the eradication of most evil practice Sati. </p>

									<p>"Hello, World!" programs vary in complexity between different languages. In some languages, particularly scripting languages, the "Hello, World!" program can be written as a single statement, while in others (particularly many low-level languages) there can be many more statements required. For example, in Python, to print the string Hello, World! followed by a newline, one need only write print("Hello, World!"). In contrast, the equivalent code in C++ [1] requires the import of the input/output software library, the manual declaration of an entry point, and the explicit instruction that the output string should be sent to the standard output stream. Generally, programming languages that give the programmer more control over the machine will result in more complex "Hello, World" programs.</p>
