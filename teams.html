												<h3>Navraj Pandey</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At her adult age, she leaves her father's house and moves to Devghat, a religious place for Hindus. There she makes a small hut and starts to live a long, boring life. The story mainly tries to reveal the terrible cultural practice called child marriage. This story also portrays the pain of a child widow living her whole life without company. The novel best tries to shows bitter reality of Ancient Nepal where women have to suffer very much after the eradication of most evil practice Sati. </p>
